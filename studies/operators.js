*
* OPERATORS: 
*
*   Operators perform a sort of operation on values that produces a result.
*   Operators are classified by what they do and how many operands they use to perform that action.
*   Operands are the values in which the operators act upon. JavaScript has unary operators, binary operators, 
*   and only one ternary operator. 
*   Unary uses one operand.         syntax=>  operand  operator     or    operator  operand
*   Binary uses two operands.       syntax=>  operand  operator  operand            
*   Ternary uses three operands.    syntaxt=> conditional operand  ?  operand : operand

// 1. Arithmetic Operators //
// Arithmetic operators are used to perform arithmetic actions on numbers.

// These are the arithmetic operators.
// +	Addition     AND     The + operator can also be used to add (concatenate) strings.
// -	Subtraction
// *	Multiplication
// **	Exponentiation 
// /	Division
// %	Division Remainder
// ++	Increment
// --	Decrement

//Example of Addition Operator
// when adding:
var c = 3
var b = 2
var a = b + c
console.log(a) // prints => 5

//when concatanating:






// JavaScript Assignment Operators
// Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables.

// Operator	Example	Same As
// =	x = y	x = y
// +=	x += y	x = x + y
// -=	x -= y	x = x - y
// *=	x *= y	x = x * y
// /=	x /= y	x = x / y
// %=	x %= y	x = x % y
// **=	x **= y	x = x ** y
// The addition assignment operator (+=) adds a value to a variable.


// JavaScript Comparison Operators
// Operator	Description
// ==	equal to
// ===	equal value and equal type
// !=	not equal
// !==	not equal value or not equal type
// >	greater than
// <	less than
// >=	greater than or equal to
// <=	less than or equal to
// ?	ternary operator



// JavaScript Logical Operators
// Operator	Description
// &&	logical and
// ||	logical or
// !	logical not


// Unary operators
// A unary operation is an operation with only one operand.
//needs example and whats an operand


// The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands: 
// a condition followed by a question mark (?), then an expression to execute if the condition is
// truthy followed by a colon (:), and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy. 
// This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the if statement.
